# MyReads Project

This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree and utilizes the React framework to create an interactive app for storing and managing a reading list. Udacity provided the HTML and CSS starter code for this project, as well as a backend server and some API request functions. We added all of the functionality for the app using React.

## Installation

To run this app, clone the project to your local machine. In your terminal, cd into the directory, then run `npm install` to install all dependencies, and `npm run start` to start the server. The project should open in your browser automatically, but if not, open your browser window and navigate to "localhost:3000".

## Instructions

Use the menu associated with each book to organize your books into shelves containing books you are currently reading, books you would like to read, and books you have already read. Or, select 'none' to remove a book from your shelves. Navigate to the search page to add new books to your shelves.

Note:
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms contains the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This is a project for a course, so I will not be actively maintaining it.
